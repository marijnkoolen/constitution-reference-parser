# constitution-reference-parser
Python implementation to extract internal references in national constitutions

This is part of the Legal Structures project, a Digging Into Data Challenge 2013 funded research project to study references structures in civil codes and constitutions across countries to map families of legal traditions.

The constitutions for this project are derived from the [Constitute Project](https://www.constituteproject.org/).

The current parser is not complete, in that the initial step from raw HTML files to structured JSON documents of constitutions is not yet implemented in Python.
